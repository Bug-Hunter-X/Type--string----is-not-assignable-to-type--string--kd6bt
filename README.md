# Type 'string[]' is not assignable to type 'string' in TypeScript

This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript error related to type mismatches.  The `bug.ts` file shows the error, while `bugSolution.ts` presents a corrected version.

The error arises when an array of strings is passed as an argument to a function expecting a single string.  This is a frequent mistake, and understanding how to fix it is crucial for writing robust TypeScript code.
